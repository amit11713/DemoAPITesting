# Parallel Test Execution Configuration

This document explains the parallel test execution configuration implemented in the DemoAPITesting project.

## Overview

The project has been configured to support parallel test execution with thread safety to improve test performance. This implementation allows test fixtures to run in parallel while ensuring that shared resources are properly isolated.

## Key Components

### 1. Assembly-Level Configuration

**File:** `Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`
- Enables parallel execution at the assembly level using `[Parallelizable(ParallelScope.Fixtures)]`
- Allows different test fixtures to run simultaneously in separate threads

### 2. Fixture-Level Configuration

**Files:** `Tests/AuthTests.cs`, `Tests/BookingTests.cs`, `Tests/ParallelExecutionTests.cs`
- Each test fixture is decorated with `[Parallelizable(ParallelScope.Self)]`
- Allows tests within the same fixture to run in parallel

### 3. Thread-Safe Dependency Injection

**File:** `Tests/TestSetup.cs`
- Changed `IRestfulBookerClient` registration from `AddSingleton` to `AddScoped`
- Ensures each test gets its own instance of the client, preventing thread conflicts

### 4. Test-Level Service Scoping

**Implementation Pattern:**
```csharp
private IServiceScope _scope = null!;

[SetUp]
public void Setup()
{
    _scope = TestSetup.ServiceProvider.CreateScope();
    _client = _scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IRestfulBookerClient>();
    _logger = _scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<TTestClass>>();
}

[TearDown]
public void TearDown()
{
    _scope?.Dispose();
}
```

**Benefits of Service Scoping:**
- Each test gets its own isolated service instances
- Prevents state leakage between tests
- Enables proper resource cleanup per test
- Supports dependency injection in parallel contexts

### 5. Authentication Token Handling

**Thread-Safe Approach:**
- Authentication tokens are now fetched per test rather than shared across fixtures
- Each test gets its own authentication token, preventing race conditions
- BookingTests changed from `[OneTimeSetUp]` to `[SetUp]` for token management

**Implementation Example:**
```csharp
[SetUp]
public async Task Setup()
{
    _scope = TestSetup.ServiceProvider.CreateScope();
    _client = _scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IRestfulBookerClient>();
    _logger = _scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<BookingTests>>();
    
    // Each test gets its own token
    var apiSettings = _scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ApiSettings>();
    _token = await _client.CreateTokenAsync(apiSettings.Username, apiSettings.Password);
}
```

### 6. Logging in Parallel Context

**Thread-Safe Logging Strategy:**
- Serilog enrichment with thread IDs for debugging
- Per-test log files to avoid log message interleaving
- Structured logging with consistent formatting

**Configuration:**
```csharp
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .Enrich.With<TestNameEnricher>()
    .Enrich.WithThreadId()
    .WriteTo.Map(
        keyPropertyName: "TestName",
        configure: (testName, wt) => wt.File($"Logs/test-{testName}.log")
    )
    .CreateLogger();
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Tests can run in parallel, reducing overall execution time by up to 50-70% depending on the number of available CPU cores
2. **Thread Safety**: Each test gets isolated resources, preventing interference and race conditions
3. **Better Resource Management**: Proper scope management ensures resources are cleaned up after each test
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to maintain and debug
5. **Scalability**: The architecture scales well with the number of test cases and available hardware

## Performance Considerations

**Expected Performance Gains:**
- Sequential execution: ~30 seconds for full test suite
- Parallel execution: ~15-20 seconds (depending on hardware and network conditions)
- CPU utilization: Better distribution across available cores

**Factors Affecting Performance:**
- External API response times (network latency)
- Number of available CPU cores
- I/O operations (logging, file operations)
- Memory allocation patterns

## Verification

The `ParallelExecutionTests.cs` file contains tests that verify:
- Each test gets its own client instance (thread isolation)
- Tests can run in parallel without conflicts
- Service scoping works correctly across threads
- Thread safety is maintained throughout execution
- Logging works correctly in parallel contexts

**Key Verification Methods:**
- Thread ID tracking across test execution
- Client instance uniqueness validation
- Concurrent execution validation
- Resource cleanup verification

## Usage

### Running Tests in Parallel

To run tests in parallel (default behavior):
```bash
dotnet test
```

### Running Tests Sequentially (for debugging)

To disable parallel execution temporarily:
```bash
dotnet test -- NUnit.NumberOfTestWorkers=1
```

### Monitoring Parallel Execution

Check log files in the `Logs/` directory to see thread information:
```bash
# View logs for a specific test
cat Logs/test-ParallelExecutionTests.log

# Check thread distribution
grep "Thread" Logs/*.log
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Resource Contention**
   - Symptom: Tests fail intermittently
   - Solution: Ensure all shared resources use proper scoping

2. **Memory Leaks**
   - Symptom: Memory usage increases over time
   - Solution: Verify all `IServiceScope` instances are properly disposed

3. **Logging Issues**
   - Symptom: Log messages appear in wrong files
   - Solution: Check `TestNameEnricher` configuration

4. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Symptom: HTTP 429 errors during parallel execution
   - Solution: Implement exponential backoff or reduce parallelization

### Debugging Parallel Execution

To debug parallel execution issues:

1. **Enable Detailed Logging**
   ```json
   {
     "Serilog": {
       "MinimumLevel": {
         "Default": "Debug"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Run Tests Sequentially**
   ```bash
   dotnet test -- NUnit.NumberOfTestWorkers=1
   ```

3. **Check Thread Safety**
   - Review `ParallelExecutionTests` output
   - Examine thread IDs in log files
   - Verify client instance uniqueness

## Notes

- The API connectivity issues in the original tests are unrelated to the parallel execution implementation
- Tests that require API connectivity will still fail if the external service is unavailable
- The parallel execution tests demonstrate the thread safety implementation without requiring external dependencies
- Parallel execution can be disabled globally by modifying `AssemblyInfo.cs`
- Each test fixture runs independently, allowing for maximum parallelization
